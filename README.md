## Kaggle competiton 
### Description :-
- Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.
- But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
- With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
